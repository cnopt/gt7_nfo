The RX-8 had two distinct personalities, depending on the gearbox you chose. Cars equipped with the 6-speed manual drove like a pure sport car, with brisk acceleration and more driver control, while those with the 6-speed automatic essentially behaved like luxury grand tourers. The Spirit R equipped with the 6-speed manual was based on the sporty Type RS, and featured extra aero parts and a sporty suspension setup, complete with Bilstein dampers. The automatic Spirit R was based on the Type E and included luxury accoutrements, such as leather seats. The car's Renesis rotary engine produced 235HP and 159 ft.-lb. of torque. The lifespan of the Spirit R was short-lived, as Mazda discontinued the RX-8 in June 2012. Because of that, initial orders for the Spirit R exceeded the intended batch of 1000 units, so Mazda produced another 1000 to meet demand."
